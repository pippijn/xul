<p>The mousethrough attribute is typically used in conjunction with a stack to allow elements to be stacked above other elements yet allow mouse events to be sent to lower elements. In the following example, the image appears above the button, yet the mousethrough attribute specified on the image causes mouse events to be ignored on the image and instead fall through to the button. If the mousethrough attribute was not used, the image would receive all mouse events and the button could not be pressed with the mouse.</p>
