<p>For example, the site identity panel that appears when you click on the favicon in the URLÂ bar in Firefox is an arrow panel:</p>
<p><img src="/@api/deki/files/4775/=arrowpanel.png" alt="arrowpanel.png" class="internal default" /></p>
</div>
<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The arrow will draw as long as the panel doesn't overlap the anchor. If they overlap, the anchor won't be drawn. Also, the directionality of the anchor depends on the locale; for left-to-right locales, the arrow draws at the left side, while for right-to-left locales, it draws at the right.</div></body></content>
