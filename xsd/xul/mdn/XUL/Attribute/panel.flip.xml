For example, if the menu doesn't have room to open downward, it flips to open upward instead; this is a vertical flip. Horizontal flipping doesn't normally happen, since this would cause menus to open in strange places. For arrow popups, however, being able to flip horizontally makes sense. This attribute, set to <code>both</code>, permits that behavior. You will not normally have to use this attribute, since it's automatically applied to arrow panels.</dd>
